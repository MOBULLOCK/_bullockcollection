## Metadata Standards
I adhered to the Dublic Core Metadata Element Set as a framework and used most of the core properties to guide the categories to aid my description of my materials. Most of my materials are public domain items from Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture made available thorugh the New York Public Library's general digital collections site and, though I consulted the Library of Congress Subject Headings and Name Authority File independently, I also deferred to the Schomburg's illustration of description practices and use of controlled vocabularies so that these materials maintained their culturally specific context even within the boundaries of these official standards.
